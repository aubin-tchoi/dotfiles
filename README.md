## 🌺 Purpose

Automate the setup of a brand-new Ubuntu machine with some cool stuff like auto-suggestions or syntax highlighting, for
instance.

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone this repo and run the installation script `install.sh`.
This script adds symlink to the files in the cloned repository rather than copying configuration files, therefore
updating the config can be done through a pull.
